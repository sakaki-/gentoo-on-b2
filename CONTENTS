  Brief description of the project, image installation and use
configs/b2_live_usb_config
  The .config used on the live-USB image kernel (assumes you have an
  internal hard drive in your B2, the most usual case); command line
  set to wait 5 seconds after boot, then look for a root on /dev/sdb3
configs/b2_live_usb_diskless_config
  As above, but targeting the case where you have no internal drive in
  your B2 (looks for root on /dev/sda3 instead)
configs/b2_sda3_root_config
  The .config used when booting directly from the internal hard drive
  (looks for a root on /dev/sda3, but no rootdelay)
configs/b2_stock_config
  The .config from a standard B2 (running Linux 2.6.39), which informed the
  above
reference/8313E21.dts
  Device tree description for the B2, reverse compiled from the 8313E21.dtb
  file, from a shipped B2's /boot directory
reference/buildkernel-b2.pdf
  PDF version of the manpage for the buildkernel-b2 utility; explains (inter alia)
  how the kernel relocation shim works
reference/fstab-on-b2
  The /etc/fstab to be used if installing onto the internal drive; has
  boot on /dev/sda1, swap on /dev/sda2, and root on /dev/sda3
reference/fstab-on-live-usb
  The /etc/fstab from the main USB image; has boot on /dev/sdb1,
  swap on /dev/sdb2, and root on /dev/sdb3 (we preserve the swap even when
  booting from USB, as the B2 is so memory constrained)
reference/fstab-on-live-usb-diskless
  The /etc/fstab from the diskless USB image; identical to fstab-on-b2
reference/genup-lite.pdf
  PDF version of the manpage for the genup-lite utility; explains the stepwise
  process of updating a Gentoo system
reference/installed-packages
  Full list of installed packages, from eix-installed all; the version numbers
  are Gentoo ebuilds, but they generally map 1-to-1 onto upstream versions
reference/showem-lite.pdf
  PDF version of the manpage for the showem-lite utility (used to monitor
  parallel emerge runs)
utils/b2_blinktest_init
  The init (a busybox ash shell script) used in the blinktest image
